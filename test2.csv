2275,co.loona,96,- WHAT IS LOÓNA?
2276,co.loona,96,"Loóna is the first app that lets you take care of your mind and body wellness with the help of intractive coloring sessions, breathing exercises, positive affirmations, and bedtime stories and gets you in the right mood to sleep soundly."
2277,co.loona,96,"- SO, IT'S ANOTHER APP TO HELP YOU SLEEP WELL, RIGHT?"
2278,co.loona,96,"Not exactly. Loóna isn’t a list of direct ""go-to-sleep"" techniques, but rather a mood-altering app. Stay calm during the day by listening to ocean waves and wind sound, prepare yourself to fall asleep easily in the evening with the help of storytelling and coloring."
2279,co.loona,96,- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?
2280,co.loona,96,"Negative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood to sleep well."
2281,co.loona,96,- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?
2282,co.loona,96,"From the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that bundles together CBT, activity-based relaxation, storytelling and sleep sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, relieve anxiety, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep. Focus on calming activities to stop ruminating and quiet your racing thoughts."
2283,co.loona,96,- IS IT DIFFERENT FROM SLEEP MEDITATION?
2284,co.loona,96,Mastering sleep meditation techniques requires a lot of patience and time. Starting your Loóna journey is as easy as playing a relaxing game for just 15 minutes a day.
2285,co.loona,96,- Does it help with Insomnia?
2286,co.loona,96,87% of Loóna users reported improvement in sleep quality after 14 days of use. Escape sessions help users beat insomnia and fall asleep fast.
2287,co.loona,96,- CAN I USE PHONE BEFORE BED?
2288,co.loona,96,"Loóna uses dimmer, warmer colors that are less likely to suppress melatonin. While the session of coloring itself has been shown to have a calming effect and can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can also improve sleep quality. Additionally, focusing on coloring can help distract your mind from the stresses of the day and promote a sense of mindfulness and relaxation."
2289,co.loona,96,"Incorporating Loóna into bedtime routine helps decrease time spent on scrolling social networks. Because scrolling social networks before bedtime exposes you to bright screens and blue light, which can suppress melatonin production and interfere with your sleep-wake cycle."
2290,co.loona,96,What do you get:
2291,co.loona,96,- 70+ interactive sleepscape journeys and relaxing games for sleeping

2864,com.appsci.sleep,117,"<b>Avrora</b> is a perfect sleep solution for those who would like to fall asleep easily and wake up energized with the help of special breathing technique, meditation sessions, calming sounds  and refreshing alarm melodies."
2865,com.appsci.sleep,117,"<b>Avrora</b> is based on the only extremely effective 🚀drug-free 🙅‍♀️ option for overcoming sleeping problems. Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits✨."
2866,com.appsci.sleep,117,⭐️ <b>HOW AVRORA WORKS</b>
2867,com.appsci.sleep,117,⭐️ <b>Falling asleep:</b>
2868,com.appsci.sleep,117,"Deep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep."
2869,com.appsci.sleep,117,⭐️ <b>Sleep retention:</b>
2870,com.appsci.sleep,117,"Breathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning."
2871,com.appsci.sleep,117,⭐️ <b>Awakening:</b>
2872,com.appsci.sleep,117,"After a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. <b>Smart alarm</b> analyzes your sleeping schedule and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts."
